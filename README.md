# iCalculator

As my endeavour to learn Objective-C, I built this fully functional calculator. This calculator is capable of performing all the basic operations. Further, since the buttons are dynamically set, users have can edit the number of buttons they want and also resize the buttons. The app can work on all iphone sizes but doesn't support screen rotations currently.
